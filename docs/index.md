Docker Compose
Docker Compose is the simplest way to start a Grid. Use the linked resources below, save them locally, and check the execution instructions on top of each file.

Version 2
docker-compose-v2.yml

Version 3
docker-compose-v3.yml

To stop the Grid and cleanup the created containers, run docker-compose down.

Version 3 with Swarm support
docker-compose-v3-swarm.yml
